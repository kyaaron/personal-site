            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p class="about-me-paragraphs">I am a software developer based out of Seoul, South Korea. But before my life in the coding world, I worked in the sports industry in Washington, D.C. In the span of several years, I interned or worked with the Commanders, Capitals, Wizards, Nationals, and D.C. United. To this day, I love watching and playing sports and trying to keep active.</p>
            <p class="about-me-paragraphs">When I left the sports industry, I started learning HTML to help with my next job. I was copying and pasting pre-made HTML to make things work, but I wanted to know what I was actually coding. So I took an intro HTML course on Codecademy and got hooked! That's when I knew I wanted to start programming and learning to make applications.</p>
            <p class="about-me-paragraphs">I started learning full-stack web development using freeCodeCamp. Around the same time, I began my first job in IT working at a Service Desk. Our development team at my company was using Pega low-code development to maintain a project management application, so I self-taught myself Pega to transition to the development team. I find myself continuing to learn on freeCodeCamp and interacting with their community on Discord. It's fun to learn and help others as they are starting out.</p>
            <p class="about-me-paragraphs">Today I continue learning, making projects, and continuing my career in software development and IT.
